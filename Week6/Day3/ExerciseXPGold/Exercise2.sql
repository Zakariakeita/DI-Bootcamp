--Some people will be frightened by watching scary movies while zombies walk the streets. Create a ‘safe list’ of all movies which do not include the ‘Horror’ category, or contain the words ‘beast’, ‘monster’, ‘ghost’, ‘dead’, ‘zombie’, or ‘undead’ in their titles or descriptions… Get the sum of their viewing time (length).
--Hint : use the CHECK contraint

--For both the ‘general’ and the ‘safe’ lists above, also calculate the time in hours and days (not just minutes).
