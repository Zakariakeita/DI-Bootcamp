# Exercise 1
# Add an ‘image’ field to the Animal model. Add images (either as image data or as URLs to images (local or remote)) so that when an animal is displayed, it is accompanied by a relevant image.

# Do some modifications in the views :
# /family/X : Order the animals by name. Add a counter with the number of animals existing in this family
# /animal/X : Next to the name of the animal, display the name of its family (a link that redirects to /family/X)
# /animals/ : Order the animals by their family’s name.
# /animals/speed : Filter the animals depending on their speed. Order them by speed.
