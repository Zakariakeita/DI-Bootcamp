# Exercise 7 : Upcoming Holiday
'''Instructions
Write a function that displays todayâ€™s date.
The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming holiday and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.'''

    print(f"Today date: {today}")

    year = int(today.strftime('%Y'))
    NG_holidays = holidays.Nigeria(years = year)
    # print(NG_holidays)

    # Print all the holidays in Nigeria
    last_day_of_year =  date((year+1),1,1)
    upcoming_date = last_day_of_year  # Init to end of this year
